#Faroese babel language package

## Status
Progress.

1. Copied the danish `ldf` file.
2. Implemented captions 

Still needs some work to be considered complete. 


## Usage
I use MacTeX, and I have placed the language definition file (ldf) in `~/Library/texmf/tex/generic/babel/`.

On other platforms the path may vary. See [http://tex.stackexchange.com/a/8359/10738]().
